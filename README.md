# BODYBUILDING-POSES-DETECTION

This is just a fun project that I made to predict whether bodybuilders are doing the correct poses in the category (just double biceps until now).

It can extend to a world where this technology is on all gym mirrors and "normal" people could pose in front of them, and the result shows at the same time.

OpenCV and MediaPipe give us the power to explore the world of computer vision, but we also can do it with segmentation, for instance. It's that thing: "GIVE ME 10,000 LABELED IMAGES, AND WE TALK MORE LATER."
